The skins aren't all that thick but aren't exactly flimsy either. Certain long, dangly bits like the kickstand were a bit annoying to peel off; a second pair of hands to prevent it from sticking to itself would have been nice, but nothing tore or stretched.

It took several minutes to set up, the hardest bit being the tiny squares covering the player # lights on the joycon grip. Speaking of... the alignment bugs me a bit; I couldn't avoid partially obscuring the lights on one side.

1lit40s,On the possibility of a Nintendo Direct for June 26th,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1lit40s/on_the_possibility_of_a_nintendo_direct_for_june/,0,1750714313.0,15,"# Premise

Right now, especially after the Bananza Direct, we're left in the dark regarding Nintendo's future schedule.

Surely, some announcements will be made before September (as games need at least one month of marketing cycle), but nothing hints yet at a general direct—until now.

Earlier this year there was a data leak at Arc System Works, the developer of Guilty Gear and the newly announced Marvel Tokon fighting game. In this leak it was revealed that they had planned an exclusive Nintendo Switch 2 title for november this year (code name: Watari).

# Where it all comes together

Today, Arc System Works announced a showcase for June 27th, featuring announced and unannounced games. As of right now, no third party studio has announced any kind of Nintendo switch 2 exclusive game at its own conference, leading to a plausible announcement by Nintendo beforehand.

June 26th, a Thursday, would fall among the typical Nintendo schedule for directs, allowing to show more first and third parties release dates for the upcoming fall season. 

# Potential weaknesses of the theory

* Nintendo could ignore a general direct until Donkey Kong Bananza is released
* Many announcements or release dates could be published on their own, just like what happened with Splatoon Raiders
* There is no guarantee that such a game from Arc System Works couldn't be announced in a September direct (since it would still be pretty far off from the November release schedule

1lioetu,Wanted to recommend this wireless controller dongle to anyone who already owns a ps5 or Xbox controller,https://i.redd.it/nrlxu0050q8f1.jpeg,78,1750703431.0,53,"This isn’t revolutionary, but I thought this dongle was super cute when I was on the market for one. I’m someone who wants a switch 2 controller but thought “I already own a $200 pro controller for ps5. Can I really not just use this?” 

So anyway, I wanted to break down how to use this product- 

- UPDATE dongle for switch 2 compatibility. It will not be functional on S2 out of box. I googled “8bitdo switch 2 update” and quickly followed step by step download for the updater, plug in dongle to pc, click and update

- ENABLE “Nintendo Switch Pro Controller Wired Communication” in settings- mine was off by default and I thought I had a non functioning product (settings > controllers and accessories > toggle this on (towards the bottom of that section) 

And then pair as normal. For ps5 hold ps button and left menu key for 3 seconds to enter pairing mode and push the button on the dongle to also put the dongle in pairing mode. (Side note- put your ps5 off- not rest mode- and unplug to avoid annoying pairing issues initially. The controller will now wake the switch until repaired to ps5) 

Bam that was it! Functions perfectly using my dualsense edge on switch. It’s great for cyberpunk. The only cons are that you need to be someone who is fluent with “translating” button prompts. Aka the Sony controller is obviously labeled differently. Same with Xbox. Same positionings but you get what I’m saying. If knowing that “X” on Nintendo is “triangle” on ps5 is an easy thing for you it’s NBD. If you’re someone who relies on looking down at the controller ever for what button is what, you’re not going to like this and may want a Nintendo product. 

I’m very happy to not have to have another controller as I have a ton of quality gaming stuff already and for $20 I thought this was a really cool product!

1limi7h,Switch 2 Upgrade clarification,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1limi7h/switch_2_upgrade_clarification/,44,1750699133.0,24,"
since there seems to be confusion over how pricing on playing older games on the Switch 2 works, and what The Switch 2 editions of games are versus free updates, I wanted to inject some clarification

There are 4 different kinds of ways that digital and physical games are played through the Switch 2.

1. You can play all Switch 1 games that you own, for free through backwards compatibility for games that don’t have compatibility issues. The list of incompatible games have become even fewer since the console’s launch due to compatibility updates with software and system updates.

2. Nintendo has released free updates for Switch 1 games that provide enhanced backwards compatibility features, like gameshare, increased resolution on handheld screen and tv, increased framerate. These are still switch 1 games playing in backwards compatibility mode.

3. Switch 2 editions are 10 dollar, native Switch 2 ports of Switch 1 games that take full advantage of the Switch 2 hardware and features that make sense for the game.

4. Switch 2 editions that are 20 dollars are ones that have brand new dlc expansions along with the native port of the Switch 1 game.

Edit: some of the comments have made excellent points, including the fact that:

A. Third party pricing for Switch 2 editions can have different pricing, but so far have not been more than 10 dollars, and in some cases have been less or free. 

Edit: it was also pointed out that despite the fact that some 3rd party games have a Switch 2 version upgrade path, some don’t and require purchasing the full version of the Switch 2 game.

B. if you have Nintendo Switch Online +expansion pass, then the Zelda Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom Switch 2 edition upgrades are free as long as you maintain your membership.


C. Some games that have dynamic resolutions and frame-rates will benefit more being played on the Switch 2, even without updates.",since seem confusion pricing play old game switch work switch edition game versus free update want inject clarification different kind way digital physical game play switch play switch game free backwards compatibility game dont compatibility issue list incompatible game become even few since console launch due compatibility update software system update nintendo release free update switch game provide enhance backwards compatibility feature like gameshare increase resolution handheld screen tv increase framerate still switch game play backwards compatibility mode switch edition dollar native switch port switch game take full advantage switch hardware feature make sense game switch edition dollar one brand new dlc expansion along native port switch game edit comment make excellent point include fact third party pricing switch edition different pricing far dollar case less free edit also point despite fact rd party game switch version upgrade path dont require purchase full version switch game b nintendo switch online expansion pas zelda breath wild tear kingdom switch edition upgrade free long maintain membership c game dynamic resolution frame rate benefit played switch even without update,"{'neg': 0.01, 'neu': 0.72, 'pos': 0.27, 'compound': 0.9939}",positive

2025 marks the 40th anniversary of Super Mario, and I’m wondering two things:
1.	How likely is it that we’ll get a brand-new 3D Mario this year?
2.	And will Nintendo do a Mario-focused Direct again, like they did for the 35th anniversary?

We’re already getting a new Donkey Kong game this year, which is exciting — but I’m still really hoping we’ll also get a full new 3D Mario title. The last big one was Super Mario Odyssey back in 2017, and with the Switch 2 now out, the timing feels perfect.

Do you think Nintendo’s saving something for a special Mario Direct? Or is Donkey Kong their big platformer focus this year?

Would love to hear what others are thinking!

1lih2ll,Review: after hours of research I settled for these accessories.,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lih2ll,52,1750686544.0,24,"# RDS Industries - Game Traveler Deluxe Complete System Case 

This I would give a 9/10. It's very sturdy, and protective, and the dimensions work well. You can fit a switch with controllers attached, extra controller pair, a pro controller, game cartridges and the dock + charging cables. I got this for international travel when I want to take my entire switch with me. 

# PowerA Slim Case 

This I finally settled on after raving reviews. I was originally going to get the TomToc case, and I did buy it but returned it. It seems the fit was too tight and may have damaged the buttons. It wasn't right for me, but I know it does work for some people. The price was high too, after taxes the TomToc case comes to $40 but the PowerA case seems both a better fit and only $23 after taxes. 

# INIU Power Bank, 20000mAh 65W

This I bought for playing on the go or if I am traveling and don't have access to an outlet. Again, it works very well with the Switch 2. You have to make sure you're also using high speed USB C cables. I can charge the Switch while using it, and have no complaints. I've gotten around 2-3 full charges on it. It also charges very fast.

Question - so I was trying to optimize the hdr on my TCL series 5. But I’m getting all confused and now the colors are all weird.

So the settings I’ve found that I can change are:

Under main settings:

-TV INPUTS > HDMI MODE > changed to standard which then prompted my switch to say “your tv is compatible with HDR”

- auto low latency mode (I put this to on)

Under the side bar settings what’s I am on the switch input (and an HDR logo pops up in the corner of the screen when I open the switch input):

- Picture mode > was defaulted to Dark HDR

- Customize Picture > game mode (says on but with a lock next to it

The issue is, when I have this set up, the over all colors look washed out and when I adjust the HDR in the switch settings I can’t get the sun on the right to disappear without the sun on the left to be significantly faded.

Does that make any sense? Anyone able to guide me through this?

I can shrug it off and enjoy the game as is, or I can wait for a possible upgrade in the future, maybe around Prime 4’s release. I want to get the most out of it so I might just wait and see, especially given that the game has already been upscaled to 4K via emulation. 

Anybody else putting a game aside for now in anticipation of an upgrade?

1lhzmt4,PSA: Best HDR settings for perfect picture quality on your TV if you own a TCL TV,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1lhzmt4/psa_best_hdr_settings_for_perfect_picture_quality/,26,1750628906.0,6,"This took me a while to figure out but once I found the right settings the picture quality is staggeringly beautiful. My TV is a TCL QM8B and I'm on firmware v531. 

Step 1: 

In your Nintendo Switch settings make sure you enable HDR Output for ""Compatible Software Only"" in Display settings. 

────────

Step 2: 

**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP.** Access Game Bar while your Switch 2 is on by holding the three line button on your remote. Go into Menu in Game Bar and enable HGIG. The reason HGiG is so crucial for HDR is because it gives you the purest image streamed directly from your console to your TV with no artifacts or loss of detail. 

────────

Step 3:  

Go back to Display on your Nintendo Switch 2 and go to ""Adjust HDR"" and click a total of 92 times. Both suns will disappear because TCL displays are much brighter than most TVs by design. 92 clicks is 1000 nits, 102 is 1100 nits, 112 clicks is 1200 nits etc. The next page will set the brightness automatically. You can also adjust this if you want by pressing the y button. 6 clicks from the dimmest is around a Paper White of 200 which is the recommended settings for HDR gaming. My TV is an TCL QM8B with a peak brightness value of 1300 nits so I set my Switch 2 to 122 clicks and 5 clicks for paper white of 200. 

You can verify your TVs current nit value in Cyberpunk 2077 in the settings menu of the game.

Here's HDTVTest's full Switch 2 HDR chart for reference:

https://i.ibb.co/TMvhT5gj/Screenshot-20250623-190558-273.png

────────

**FOR THOSE WITHOUT HGiG:**

If you don't have HGiG you can still get a decent image by leaving Dynamic Tone Mapping on, in the Switch 2 HDR settings click until the the LEFT SUN is very dark and then two clicks back to brighten it up slightly.

***PSA: NEVER SET DYNAMIC
 TONE MAPPING TO OFF IT'S THE WORST PICTURE QUALITY. IT'S NOT THE SAME AS HGiG.***

This video explains the differences in detail with examples:

https://youtu.be/mAtULIEQvjQ

This video is also very good:

https://youtu.be/VGO38f1EoYE

And this video is essential:

https://youtu.be/_BmkMcaqpX8

Your other option is to turn HDR off completely. 

──────── 

Conclusion: 

My Switch 2 looks amazing! Breath of the Wild and Mario Kart World now look very sharp and clean on my TV.
